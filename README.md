# Cost of Living
Welcome to our 'Foundations of Statistics' project repository. Here, we delve into a comprehensive analysis of living costs across 4500 cities worldwide.

Our journey begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the dataset. This initial phase aims to uncover various patterns and insights, all of which are detailed in the 'eda.Rmd' file.

Moving forward, we proceed to calculate the Cost of Living Index (COLI), facilitating a holistic comparison among the diverse cities. For a detailed breakdown of our COLI analysis, refer to the 'coli.Rmd' file.

In our concluding phase, we delve into an insightful comparison between developed and developing countries.

Join us as we navigate through the intricacies of statistical analysis and unveil meaningful insights into global living costs.
